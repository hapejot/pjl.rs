Here's a structured write-up of the three approaches you mentioned, including expanded explanations, key challenges, and benefits for each. I've also added a fourth option for consideration, which may help broaden your architectural thinking.

## **Options for Bringing Standard Fiori Functions into SAP BTP**

To enable modern, scalable, and cloud-based access to standard Fiori functionality on SAP BTP, several architectural approaches can be considered. Below are the detailed explanations, benefits, and challenges for each option.

---

### **Option 1: Rebuilding in SAP Build Apps (Low-Code/No-Code)**

**Description:**
Recreate standard Fiori functionalities using **SAP Build Apps**, a low-code/no-code environment that enables visual development and rapid deployment of business applications.

**Benefits:**

* Rapid development with visual tools.
* Good integration with BTP services like SAP Mobile Services, Workflow, or Business Rules.
* Ideal for lightweight apps or extensions that donâ€™t require deep custom logic.

**Challenges:**

* **Scalability Limitations:** Not well-suited for large or complex apps involving significant UI logic, multiple entities, or complex tabular data (like ALV tables).
* **Feature Gaps:** Build Apps lacks deep support for Fiori design paradigms (like Smart Controls or Smart Templates).
* **Data Binding Complexity:** Binding to OData services and managing large data sets can be cumbersome.
* **Developer Frustration:** Complex business logic or advanced UX patterns may need workarounds or custom JS widgets.

**Use Case Fit:**
Lightweight apps, approval workflows, or simple forms; not ideal for applications with complex tables, dynamic filters, or editable lists.

### **Option 2: Migrating Existing Fiori Apps to SAP Build Work Zone (Advanced Edition)**

**Description:**
Deploy existing Fiori apps (from an on-premise system or S/4HANA) into the **SAP Build Work Zone**, giving users a centralized entry point for accessing apps hosted on BTP.

**Benefits:**

* Preserves existing app investments.
* Retains Fiori look and feel and application logic.
* Easily integrated into Launchpad services in Work Zone.
* Lower development effort if apps are already built and stable.

**Challenges:**

* **User Mapping Issues:** Typically, the BTP destination is configured with a **technical user**, meaning actions (like purchase requisitions) could appear to originate from the same SAP backend user unless mapped explicitly.

  * Requires identity propagation or user-substitution logic.
* **Dependency on On-Premise System Availability:** If the apps remain hosted on-premise, users rely on system uptime and network availability.
* **Performance Considerations:** Round-trips between BTP and on-premise system may lead to latency.

**Use Case Fit:**
Good for organizations looking to expose existing functionality with minimal rework and still want to leverage a modern UX via Work Zone.

### **Option 3: Hybrid Rebuild Using BTP Deployed HTML5 + Reused Backend Services**

**Description:**
Reuse backend OData or REST services from the on-premise system, but **rebuild the frontend** using modern UI5 or freestyle HTML5 in SAP BTP (deployed via the HTML5 Application Repository).

**Benefits:**

* Full control over the frontend; ability to create optimized UX.
* Can use modern JavaScript frameworks (UI5, React, etc.) depending on flexibility.
* Easy to modularize and scale compared to Build Apps.
* Better suited for complex apps (e.g., multi-table views, dynamic filters, advanced charts).

**Challenges:**

* **Higher Development Effort:** Requires full development lifecycle (coding, testing, DevOps).
* **Connectivity Setup:** Requires well-configured BTP destinations and cloud connector for accessing on-premise services.
* **User Propagation:** Needs handling of principal propagation or a substitute mechanism for user-specific operations.

**Use Case Fit:**
Best for medium-to-large apps or when redesigning for performance, UX, or mobile adaptation is desired.

### **Option 4: Use SAP Fiori Elements with CAP (Cloud Application Programming Model)**

**Description:**
Create new applications in SAP BTP using **SAP Fiori Elements** and **CAP** (Node.js or Java). Reuse backend data via OData V4 services or replicate selected datasets into HANA Cloud.

**Benefits:**

* Declarative UI creation reduces coding.
* Full adherence to Fiori UX guidelines.
* Supports draft handling, list reports, object pages natively.
* Ideal for BTP-native development with future scalability.
* Built-in multitenancy and extension capabilities.

**Challenges:**

* Learning curve for CAP and CDS annotations.
* Requires backend data availability via APIs or replication.
* Not suitable for highly customized UIs (better for data-centric apps).

**Use Case Fit:**
Ideal when building new cloud-native applications on BTP, especially if a data-driven app with list/detail/edit functionality is needed.

## **Final Thoughts**

Choosing the right option depends on your organization's priorities:

* **Speed vs. Customization**
* **Existing assets vs. New development**
* **User-specific behavior vs. shared accounts**
* **Operational complexity vs. simplicity**

Often, a **hybrid approach** works bestâ€”migrating whatâ€™s feasible and rebuilding where needed. Integrating identity provisioning (e.g., IAS + Identity Authentication Service) and secure destinations can also resolve some user mapping issues.

Let me know if you want this summarized in a presentation format or with diagrams.

Great, you're asking for an effort estimation based on implementing a defined Fiori workflow:

> **Creating & releasing purchase requisitions** and **confirming goods receipts** â€” standard MM processes that are available in Fiori apps like *Manage Purchase Requisitions*, *Approve Purchase Requisitions*, and *Post Goods Receipt for Purchase Order*.

Letâ€™s evaluate **relative effort** (development + configuration) per option based on this scope, assuming:

* Medium complexity PR scenarios (not highly customized).
* Basic user authorization setup.
* On-premise SAP S/4HANA or ECC system already providing OData or RFCs.

| **1. SAP Build Apps**                      | **High** (20â€“30 person-days)        | - Data modeling and bindings (10d)  <br> - UI for PR & GR screens (10d)  <br> - Testing and deployment (5â€“10d)                           | - Manual tabular entry of PR items is hard to build in Build Apps. <br> - No native support for Smart Tables, Approval UX. <br> - May require JS widgets or workaround logic. |
| **2. Build Work Zone with Existing Apps**  | **Lowâ€“Medium** (5â€“10 person-days)   | - Setup Work Zone (2d) <br> - Configure destinations, tiles, and roles (2â€“3d) <br> - Identity mapping & testing (3â€“5d)                   | - Leverages existing Fiori apps from S/4 or ECC. <br> - Must resolve user propagation if using technical users.                                                               |
| **3. HTML5 App with Reused Services**      | **Mediumâ€“High** (25â€“35 person-days) | - UI design (10d) <br> - Reuse and integrate OData services (10â€“15d) <br> - Identity handling & security (5d) <br> - QA & packaging (5d) | - Offers best flexibility but is full-stack dev. <br> - If services need enhancement, backend work increases.                                                                 |
| **4. Fiori Elements + CAP (Cloud-Native)** | **Medium** (15â€“25 person-days)      | - CAP project setup and CDS design (5â€“10d) <br> - Fiori Elements pages (5â€“7d) <br> - Connectivity and deployment (5â€“7d)                  | - Efficient for list/detail/edit flows like PR. <br> - Not great if complex custom UI is needed.                                                                              |

## ðŸ§© **Other Considerations**

* **Standard SAP Fiori apps for PR/GR exist** in S/4 (or ECC with Gateway), and are typically better reused (Option 2) unless there's a very specific UX need.
* **Goods Receipt Confirmation** often uses barcode scanning or mobile UIs â€” Build Apps can help here, but again struggles with repeatable data entry.
* **User Identity Mapping** is a *cross-cutting concern* in all BTP integration. If you're using IAS and principal propagation is not configured, technical users will cause traceability and audit issues in PR/GR flows.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommendations Based on Effort vs Value**

* ðŸ”¹ **If time-to-value is key** â†’ Go with **Option 2** (Work Zone + existing apps) and solve user mapping with custom logic or dynamic destinations.
* ðŸ”¹ **If your users demand a tailored UI/UX** â†’ Go for **Option 3** or **4**, depending on whether you need free-form UX (3) or standard flow (4).
* ðŸ”¹ **Avoid Build Apps (Option 1)** unless the scope is limited or you're targeting mobile-specific extensions.
